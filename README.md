# GPSViewer
## Simple track viewer and stats for SBP (more to come?) files with windsurfing in mind

Working with Locosys GW60 for now

Aiming to use SwiftUI as much as possible:
- Still waiting for the implementation of more advanced abilities for SwiftUI's MapView, embedding UIView for the time being
- Track with speed dependant color works with new MKGradientPolylineRenderer (iOS14) but rendering too slow -> disabled for now
